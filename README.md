# Pacman-godot

This is a pacman "clone" (it has major differences) that I made to learn Godot.

You can download it [here](https://github.com/henrypickler/pacman-godot/releases/latest).

Music, graphics and programming was done by me. Font is by [Camellina](https://www.dafont.com/rainyhearts.font) and some sound effects were made with [jsfxr](https://sfxr.me/).

Enjoy :)
